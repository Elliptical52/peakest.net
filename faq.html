  <h2 class="question">How do I add an album to my account?</h2>
  <p class="answer">
    First, search up an album in the "Search Albums..." field. Select the album you are trying to add.
    This will autofill the name and cover URL of the album. Then, add a link to the album on Youtube Music 
    and/or Spotify (support for more platforms coming soon!) and click add. The album will now appear to visible
    to anyone who visits your account.

  <h2 class="question">How do I remove an album from my account?</h2>
  <p class="answer">
    Hover over or tap the album on your account, then tap or click the "x" icon. A prompt will appear asking if you
    are sure you would like to remove the album. Clicking "Accept" will remove the album from your account.

  <h2 class="question">How do I edit an album on my account?</h2>
  <p class="answer">
    Hover over or tap the album on your account, then tap or click the "✎" icon. A menu will appear where you can edit
    the album. Click "Save" to apply changes.

  <h2 class="question">How do I fix a blank / broken album cover?</h2>
  <p class="answer">
    Peakest uses URLs to source album covers. If an album cover appears broken or does not appear at all, this is
    likely caused by a faulty URL. Edit the album and replace the cover URL with a working one. An easy way to find
    a working URL is by going to the page for it on Youtube Music in your browser, then right clicking the album cover 
    and clicking "Copy Image Link" or "Open Image in New Tab" and copying that URL. Alternatively, you can do this same
    process with a version of the cover found on something like Google Images.
